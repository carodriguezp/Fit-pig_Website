    { title: "Introduction", text: "In a world obsessed with physical appearance, it's easy to lose sight of what truly matters when it comes to health. 'Fit Pig' is more than just a BMI calculator. We strive to promote a more balanced and comprehensive approach to personal well-being. We recognize that weight alone does not determine health, and that body positivity should go hand in hand with responsibility and awareness." },
    { title: "BMI as a guide, not a rule", text: "The BMI calculator in 'Fit Pig' is designed to provide a general estimate of health based on weight and height. However, it is important to remember that BMI is just a rough tool and doesn't tell the whole story. Body composition, muscle mass, and other factors also play a crucial role in an individual's overall health." },
    { title: "Body positivity with responsibility", text: "At 'Fit Pig,' we embrace the body positive movement, but with a responsible and mindful approach. We acknowledge that bodies come in all shapes and sizes, and we firmly believe in the importance of accepting and loving our bodies as they are. However, we also understand that being extremely underweight or significantly overweight can have negative health consequences. Therefore, we encourage our users to strive for a healthy balance and to make choices that promote physical and mental well-being." },
    { title: "Health as a priority", text: "Ultimately, 'Fit Pig' is about promoting health and well-being in all its forms. We recognize that the true measure of a healthy life isn't found on the scale, but in how we feel physically and emotionally. Our goal is to inspire people to adopt healthy habits, to find happiness in their own bodies, and to live life to the fullest." },
    { title: "", text: "In summary, 'Fit Pig' is more than just a BMI calculator; it's a platform that promotes body positivity with awareness and responsibility. We believe that everyone deserves to feel good about themselves, regardless of their weight or appearance, and we are committed to supporting our users on their journey toward a healthier and happier life." },
